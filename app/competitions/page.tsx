              The World Human Powered Speed Challenge, held annually on State
              Route 305 in Battle Mountain, Nevada, attracts top teams worldwide
              aiming to break the human-powered land speed record, which
              currently stands at 144 km/h. This event presents a unique
              combination of engineering and athleticism, where teams refine
              their vehicle designs to reduce drag and maximize speed. In 2023,
              Monash Human Power made history by surpassing the Australian menâ€™s
              single-track record, a significant milestone in their pursuit of
              speed innovation.

              The VIC HPV Grand Prix Series is a 6-8 hour endurance race for
              human-powered vehicles (HPVs) on a circuit, offering a unique
              challenge compared to the short sprints of the World Human Powered
              Speed Challenge (WHPSC). Unlike the speed-focused events, this
              race tests vehicle durability and rider endurance over longer
              distances. Monash Human Power has entered this competition with a
              borrowed trike while developing its custom-designed trike, aiming
              to push new boundaries in endurance HPV racing.

              test the best combinations of human-powered vehicles and rider
              capabilities. Hosted at the Ford Proving Grounds in You Yangs,
              Victoria, the trials push teams to fine-tune their designs for
              peak performance under real-world conditions. The current
              Australian record for this competition stands at 96.68 km/h, with
